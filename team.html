                  Science from Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, in 2020 and her research was focused
                  on basic neuro-ophthalmology. She then went on to advance her understanding of degenerative diseases
                  by completing a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health (National Eye Institute)
                  in Bethesda, Maryland before joining the Albers Lab. Dr. Shetty is interested in how regulatory
                  barriers affect therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases and understanding how real-world evidence
                  is being utilized by the FDA. Following her fellowship at CRS, Dr. Shetty plans to explore regulatory
                  scientist roles in the biotech industry or the government. Outsie of the lab, Dr. Shetty enjoys

                  at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières in Canada. His research interests focus on cognitive and
                  cerebral aging, and on the contribution of olfactory testing and neuroimaging to the early detection
                  of neurodegenerative diseases. More specifically, his work in the Albers lab focuses on the
                  tractography of the olfactory system within early Alzheimer's disease, a neuroimaging technique
                  allowing to examine potential damage to white matter connections between different brain regions
                  related to the sense of smell. After completing his clinical training in neuropsychology, Benoît plans
                  to pursue his research on the neuroimaging of different pathologies affecting the brain and olfaction.
                  In his free time, Benoit enjoys playing ice hockey, cooking, and running.</p>
